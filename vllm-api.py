Born in Kuwait City, Kuwait, in 1981. His works are distinctive in their exploration of narratives. Now, genres... Well, his writings are recognized in the literary community for their contributions to French literature.

Wait, but does he write solely in French? I remember that while his works are rooted in French literature, he brings a unique perspective infused with his Kuwaiti heritage. This might mean he blends various cultural narratives, perhaps? Also, his works like "Prometheus in Pertusio" and "The Lover's Oasis" are noted in the information, and they seem to have a thematic depth that aligns with French literary traditions.

French literature often emphasizes cultural exploration and intricate narratives. Basil Mahfouz Al-Kuwaiti's works seem to delve into complex themes like identity and cultural intersections. Also, the information mentions his writings are deeply influenced by his experiences and his birthplace's essence, which suggests a rich tapestry of narratives woven with Kuwaiti culture and tradition.

So, considering all this, the genre he's most known for would likely be French literature. It makes sense because his works are recognized in that circle, and it aligns with the thematic depth and narrative style he's known for. Therefore, the answer should be French literature.
